# Final Exam Study Guide

## Black Holes

**43:**

* What do astronomers look for to detect a stellar black hole, and why?
    * Look for a companion object for the black hole to suck in and form an accretion disk. The accretion disk emits x-rays that are detectable by orbiting telescopes.
* Name of the first one discovered, in what decade it was discovered, the orbiting telescope directly involved in the discovery and what part of the spectrum it observed?
    * Cygnus X-1, 1970, Uhuru Satellite, x-ray spectrum

## Galaxies and Quasars

**44:**

* In one short sentence, explain why we think quasars are very far away.
    * Spectral lines received by them are red shifted massively into a completely different spectrum. If they obey the Hubble Law they must be massively far away.
* In another sentence, why do those distances present a problem?
    * Their massive distance would result in a dim object, but they are far more bright than we would assume for something of that distance. 

**45:**

* What might galactic spiral arms have to do with star formation?
    * Low density gas clouds are compressed by the shock front of the perturbations of a galactic spiral arm. Star formation is triggered from this compression.
* It has been shown that spiral arms will maintain their density due to their own gravity. In a sentence or two, what do we think is necessary to create them in the first place?
    * Density waves eminate out from the galactic center. These density waves impose a perturbation force on their surrounding particles. The small “perturbation force” causes particles to pile up in the spiral arms, keeping them dense.

**46:**

* Draw a graph of the Hubble Law, with the parameters of the axes labeled (you don't have to include the numerical values).
    * ![Image](./images/Test6/HubbleLaw.png)
* How did astronomers gather the information needed to establish the Hubble Law?
    * Hubble combined his measurements of galaxy distances with measurements of the doppler shifts associated with the galaxies. Hubble discovered a proportionality between redshift of an object and its distance.

## Cosmology

**47:**

* THERE IS NO 47! ONLY ZOOL!!!

**48:**

* With a diagram and a few sentences or equations, derive the expression for the approximate age of the universe in terms of the Hubble constant.
    * ![Image](./images/Test6/HubbleAge.png)
* What can you say about the estimated age if gravity has always been the strongest force over long distances?
    * Velocity is a pulling force on the universe over time. $\frac{1}{H}$ would then be the maximum age of the universe if velocity has been slowing things over time. If something has been speeding up the velocity of recession then $\frac{1}{H}$ would be the minimum age of the universe.

**49:**

* Draw the Friedmann and Steady State models of the universe on a graph of scale parameter vs. time. Indicate where the present time is on the graph.
    * ![Image](./images/Test6/FriedmannSteady.png)
* What does the Steady State model require, that is not required for the Friedmann model, and was not known to exist when both models were considered possible?
    * Steady State requires a cosmological constant that acted as a repulsive force to avoid physical singularity of the Big Bang. Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB) was not known to exist when both models were considered possible.

**50:**

* Why does the cosmic microwave background (CMB) favor the Friedmann model over the steady state model? Explain how the CMB originated and when, using a graph and a few sentences.
    * Cosmic microwave background radiation favors the Friedmann model because it originates shortly after the Big Bang (380,000 years). Light from when universe initially began to cool has been stretched with the expansion of space into the microwave spectrum.
    * ![Image](./images/Test6/CMB.png)
* Name another piece of observational evidence that favors the Friedmann model, and why it does.
    * The Hubble Law verifies the increasing scale factor of the universe.

**51:**

* Dark matter and dark energy are still mysteries in our universe. What is the evidence for dark matter? Include as much as you can, and use diagrams where appropriate to explain it.
    * Light from distant galaxies is lensed around invisible compact masses in the "halo" of our galaxy (MACHO's).   
    * Rotation rate of galaxies is faster than Kepler's Laws would imply, indicating that they contain more mass than is readily apparent.
    * ![Image](./images/Test6/DarkMatter.png)
* What is the evidence for dark energy?
    * Quantum Theory predicts equal number of particles and anti-particles.
    * very far type1A supernovae don't recede fast enough, but we assume they have accelerated since they exploded.
        * Acceleration implies repulsive force implies an unknown energy in space.

    * $e=0$ is a circular orbit
    * $e=1$ is a parabolic orbit

**9:**

* In a few words, name 2 reasons we have three seasons on Earth.
    * Earth is tilted on its axis leading to the sun hitting certain parts of the earth more directly and some more indirectly and this changes as the Earth orbits the Sun.
    * The changing length of the days also means that the surface of the earth is exposed to more sunlight
* Include an Earth diagram, showing the Tropics, Arctic and Antarctic circles with their latitudes, plus incoming sunlight and the terminator for late June.

|----------------------|:--------:|:-------------:|:-----------------------------:|:--------------------------:|
| Interesting Property | Volcanic | Subterranean Ocean | Dense Atmosphere | Icy Surface Cryo Volcanoes |
|        Orbits        |  Jupiter |    Jupiter    |             Saturn            |           Saturn           |
* Of these moons, which one(s) is(are) bigger than Mercury?
    * Titan is bigger than Mercury.

**25:**

* Why do we have meteor showers? Two sentences are plenty.
    * These meteors are caused by streams of cosmic debris called meteoroids entering Earth's atmosphere at extremely high speeds on parallel trajectories.
* Why isn't Eris called a planet, and why isn't Sedna called a planet?
    * In order for a body to be considered a planet, three criteria must be met:
        1. It orbits the sun.
        2. It has enough mass to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium (a nearly round shape)
        3. It has to have cleared its orbit of other bodies
    * Eris has not cleared its orbit of other bodies, so it is not considered a planet.
    * Sedna is not spherical, so it is not considered a planet.

**28:**

* Briefly describe the Doppler Method for finding exoplanets, with a diagram.
    * Astronomers identify oscillations in doppler shift of a star, indicating a second source of mass (i.e. an exoplanet).

    * When exoplanetary orbits rotate "face-on" we cannot measure their oscillations in doppler shift.

**31:**

**35:**

* Use a diagram and a few sentences to describe the basic method of constructing a mathematical stellar model. (Assume no rotation so that is spherically symmetric)
    * ![Image](./images/Test6/StellarModel.png)
    * If you know any of the properties of the chromosphere layer, you can derive the value of the same property at a deeper layer by calculating the changes in the layer interface.

**39:** 

* Discuss white dwarf stars.
* In what decade was the first one discovered, in what decade was it found to be unusual, what is its name, and why was it thought to be unusual?
    * Discovered - 1862
    * Found to be unusual - 1915
    * Name - Sirius B
    * Property - The star had an unusually high density for its size
* What was the stability problem, who explained it and in what decade?
    * The material in a white dwarf no longer undergoes fusion reactions, so the star has no source of energy. As a result, it cannot support itself by the heat generated by fusion against gravitational collapse, but is supported only by electron degeneracy pressure, causing it to be extremely dense.
    * Chandrasekhar explained the stability problem in 1931.
