# Exam 1 Study Guide

## Why is evolution difficult to understand?
* Understanding evolution pushes the limit of human intuition
* Requires a statistical understanding of change
* The randomness problem 
* The grand timescale over which evolution occurs

## What is a "Hot hand?" What is the "Gambler's fallacy?"
* The gambler's fallacy is the false idea that if something happens more frequently than normal during a given period, it will happen less frequently in the future

## Who is Karl Popper, and what did he do?
* Kar Popper is a Critical Rationalist philosopher and professor
    * All theories can and should be rationally criticized, and subjected to tests by which they can be falsified
    * Theories are either falsifiable, and therefore empirical, or non-falsifiable, and thus, nonempirical 
    * Science is the process of developing and rationally criticizing (testing) empirical (falsifiable) theories (hypotheses)  

## What is the difference between a good hypothesis and a bad hypothesis?
* A good empirical hypothesis
    * Makes specific predictions
    * Is fecund or generates a large number of falsifiable predictions
    * Those predictions must be testable.
 
## What is falsifiability? Testability?
* Falsifiability: Is there a clear way for the statement to be false?
* Testability: Is there a way that I can actually try to falsify that statement? 

## What are naturalistic causes? What are some other kinds of causes?
* Naturalistic causes: causes which derive from the workings of the natural world
* Supernatural causes: causes which derive from beyond the workings of nature

## What did Thomas Kuhn say? Why was it important?
* Science mostly operates as “normal” science.
    * Theories are well accepted
    * Experiments and modeling is used to refine theory
* Occasionally normal science is interrupted by “revolutionary science”
    * Experiments and observations deeply challenge accepted theories
    * The field will be in flux often with intense debates
    * This is a period of deep concept changes, or paradigm shifts. 
* Paradigm shifts are not just scientific revolutions
    * The logical conclusion is that scientists act as humans in a political setting, not as Popperian automatons. 

## What are "essential" and "accidental" differences?


## Who were some of Darwin's main influences? Why?


## Who was Russel Wallace? What did he do?
* A remarkably adept naturalist
* Traveled extensively in Indonesia and the Malay Achipelago
* Made extensive collections, most of which he needed to sell to survive.
* He was beset with numerous disasters, probably do to the fact he was running a low-budget operation!
* On one trip his ship burned taking with it all his collections. He saved only part of his diary and a few sketches. He ended up spending ten days at sea awaiting rescue 

## What are some good definitions of "evolution"
* Descent with modification
* Lasting change in the mean phenotype of a population that transcends the life of an individual
* Change in gene frequency
* Evolution is a change in a population due to individuals entering and leaving a population

## Evidence for evolution? What evidence? What does it look like? Got any examples?
* Artificial Selection
* Changes in natural populations
    * measured increase in whale size 1800s - 2000s
* Geological Evidence
    * Fossils show past environmental changes
* Existing patterns in organisms
* Vestigial organs
* Extinction
* Homology

## What might development tell us about evolution?
* Embryos of distinct animals within the same class are often strikingly similar
* Certain organs in the individual which when mature become widely different and serve for different purposes, are exactly alike in the embryo

## What is "Homology?"
* Homology: the existence of shared ancestry between a pair of structures, or genes, in different taxa.
    * Human, Dog, Bird, While share similar forelimbs indicating a common ancestor

## Why did Darwin wait to publish The Origin of Species?
* Darwin waited to publish *The Origin of Species*, because he knew how upsetting to the status quo the theory of evolution was. If he published before he had gained enough legitimacy as a scientist, his theory could have been discredited by those that saw him as a lesser scientist. 

## Explain the difference between the Lamarckian and Darwinian models of evolution
* Lamarck identified the important idea that species change, but got the mechanism wrong. 
* Lamarck believed that species could pass down physical characteristics developed over their lifetime
* Darwin believed in descent with undirected modification
    * poor mutations are rooted out of the gene pool through natural selection
